# EmoroIDE

## Goal

Hey! This project was made for the validation of my year in EPITA, we had to make an IDE with "special requests" from fictional clients (teachers).
The request of our client was to make the IDE in the theme of electro-music with music integration. We started by making something simple but yet working.
Although the Front-end part is almost done, the back-end on the other hand isnt currently fully operationnal.

### install project

run 
`npm install`
to install the dependencies

### execute/test the project[^1]

in `package.json`, run "dev" in order to test your project. "build" in order to build it.
in the `backend` directory, run `mvn clean compile package && java -jar ./target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` (currently only for WinOS)



[^1]: note: This Project is currently in develoopment and isnt yet ready to work on every platform.
